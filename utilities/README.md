This folder contains various scripts to help out with making this app.

`json_unstringifyer.js` lets me grab newer test data samples of the Arras() object
from Arras.io's console, and helps convert them into valid js objects for use in `index.html` or `website.html`.
`build_userscript_and_website.py` takes the files in the `src` and builds complete website html and complete userscript code out of them in the `final` folder.
