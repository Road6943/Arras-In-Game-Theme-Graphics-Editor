This folder contains the files that **SHOULD** be edited. Make sure to run `build_userscript_and_website.py` in the `utility` folder afterwards to see the final result(s) in the `final` folder.

The `boilerplate` folder contains code that is not part of the app itself, but is rather needed by the userscript/website to function properly
